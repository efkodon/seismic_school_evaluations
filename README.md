<h1 class="title">Earthquake Risk Data for Washington Public Schools is Incomplete and Out of Reach</h1>

<b>By Emily Keller-O'Donnell</b>

This project analyzes and compares information about earthquake building risks at K-12 public schools in Washington State, using multiple state and local data sources. The coding documents in this repository show the data analysis that was used for the article, “Earthquake Risk Data for Washington Public Schools is Incomplete and Out of Reach,” published in the <i>Washington State Standard</i>. 

The primary data source for this project is a spreadsheet from the Pre-Disaster Mitigation database of the <a href="https://ospi.k12.wa.us/policy-funding/school-buildings-facilities/information-and-condition-schools-icos">Information and Condition of Schools</a> (ICOS) system, obtained by public records request from the Washington Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction. This data, representing more than 2,000 schools, was provided in August 2024 and does not reflect subsequent updates. The spreadsheet contains a snapshot of information from the full database. 

Requests for a list of school seismic retrofits were sent to 14 school districts in the Puget Sound region. Seven districts provided a list of retrofits or related documents. Districts that declined to provide information said they did not have data in the requested format or did not have any retrofits. One district deferred to the state to provide the data. Two districts did not reply. These responses are incorporated into the article linked above.

Public data sources included legislative reports for the <a href="https://www.dnr.wa.gov/school-seismic-safety">School Seismic Safety Project</a> (SSSP), published by the Washington State Department of Natural Resources in 2019 and 2021, and seismic building information published by <a href="https://www.seattleschools.org/departments/capital-projects-and-planning/facilities-master-plan/seismic-information/">Seattle Public Schools</a>. These datasets have been converted to csv files, which are included in this repository.

This project revealed inconsistent building information for some of the school buildings found in both state and local data sources, which may affect the earthquake risk levels assigned to individual school buildings and campuses in the ICOS dataset. As a result, the full ICOS dataset is not published in this repository. However, excerpts from the dataset are shown within the coding documents. In addition, the glossary provided with the dataset by the state's Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction is available here.
